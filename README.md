Here's a sample `README.md` file for your student enrollment system project:

```markdown
# Student Enrollment System

This is a simple student enrollment system built using Python and SQLAlchemy. The system allows you to manage students, instructors, courses, and enrollments in an SQLite database.

## Features

- Add new students, instructors, and courses.
- Enroll students in courses.
- View lists of all students, courses, and instructors.
- View the list of courses a student is enrolled in.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- SQLAlchemy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Ensure you have Python 3 and `pip` installed.
3. Install the required packages by running:

   ```bash
   pip install sqlalchemy
   ```

4. The database will be created automatically when the program runs for the first time.

## Database Setup

The database is created using SQLite. All models (Student, Instructor, Course, Enrollment) are defined using SQLAlchemy.

```python
# Database setup
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()
db_url = "sqlite:///student_enrollment.db"
engine = create_engine(db_url, echo=True)
```

## Models

### Student
Represents a student with attributes:
- `id`: Primary key.
- `name`: The student's name.
- `email`: The student's email (unique).

### Instructor
Represents an instructor with attributes:
- `id`: Primary key.
- `name`: The instructor's name.
- `department`: The instructor's department.

### Course
Represents a course with attributes:
- `id`: Primary key.
- `title`: The course title.
- `description`: A short description of the course.
- `instructor_id`: Foreign key referencing the instructor.

### Enrollment
Represents an enrollment of a student in a course. It has a composite primary key made up of:
- `student_id`: Foreign key referencing the student.
- `course_id`: Foreign key referencing the course.

## Usage

Run the program by executing the `main.py` file. The program provides a simple text-based menu for interacting with the system.

```bash
python main.py
```
